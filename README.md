# Max-api-or-nah-test

Simple test patch which requires max-api-or-nah in both commonjs
and esm formats in max and checks that they load and you can post
a message with them.

Currently mjs version not working because of a bug in max 9.

## max-api-or-nah

install it in both the cjs and esm folders with `npm link ~/Code/max-api-or-nah`
replacing the path with wherever your dev instance is located
